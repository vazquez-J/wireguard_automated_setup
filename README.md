# Wireguard_automated_setup

This is a personal project I created in order to create wireguad clients easily by hosting them on an AWS ec2 instance.
This will create X number of VPN client profiles once done and will generate a qr code that you will be able to scan using teh wireguard application that can be found on the Android Play store.

# Requirements

The only real requirements are an Amazon Web Servies account with an IAM user that has admin priveleges.

## Install git
```bash
sudo apt-get install git -y
```
